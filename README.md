Object Detection and Recognition using RaspBerry Pi

Objective: Creating a system capable of image processing and object detection, implementing two different methods:
1.) Traditional image processing by applying the Region Growing algorithm
2.) Deep Learning using convolutional neural networks (MobileNet v2 model, CocoLabels dataset for training)

These methods are applied on images captured by a Raspberry Pi 3B camera and processed in real time by the single-board computer.
